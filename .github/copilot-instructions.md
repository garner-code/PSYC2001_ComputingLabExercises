This repository contains the scripts that are used to follow the exercises 
from a bookdown project that is for undergraduate psychology students to 
learn data analysis skills using R and RStudio. As such, it should be clear
how the exercises in these scripts map to the exercises in the 
bookdown project which is here https://github.com/garner-code/PSYC2001_ComputingLabBook

Bookdown project is in the repo PSYC2001_ComputingLabBook 
Make sure to read all the info in the Bookdown project repo
Each folder in this repo relates to a chapter in the bookdown project
Each folder contains a script that has the coding exercises in them. Note that
the code is purposefully left unfinished in these scripts as students
are meant to complete the lines of code as part of their exercises.
Each folder also contains an .Rproj file that students can double click
to open RStudio that week.
Each folder also contains a Data folder and an Output folder. These folders
should always have data in them, will not always have output in them, but
should be visible to the students for use.
Each folder also has a README.txt file that contains a description of the data.
